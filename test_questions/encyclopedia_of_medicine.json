    "question": "What is Acid phosphatase test ?",
    "answer": "Acid phosphatase is an enzyme found throughout the body, but primarily in the prostate gland. Like all enzymes, it is needed to trigger specific chemical reactions.

    "question": "What is the step-by-step process for inserting the catheter to begin an angiography?",
    "answer": "Preparation: The puncture site (commonly the groin, armpit, inside elbow, or neck) is cleaned with an antiseptic agent and injected with a local anesthetic. Incision and Needle Insertion: A small incision is made in the skin. A needle containing an inner wire, known as a stylet, is inserted through the skin and into the artery. Guide Wire Placement: Once the artery is punctured, the stylet is removed and replaced with a long guide wire (it is normal for blood to spout briefly before this wire is inserted). Catheter Advancement: The needle is removed, and a catheter is slid over the length of the guide wire. Using a fluoroscopic screen to visualize the vascular system, the catheter is piloted to the specific area of study, and the guide wire is removed to prepare for dye injection.",
